# Basic Sign-up Page

Hi here is my solution of the Sign up form assignment by 'The Odin Project'.
The page is built using vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. I used BEM naming conventions to name my css classes.

## Features

- If a field is invalid the border of the input field changes to red
- Show extra info about the input field on mouseover
- If passwords do not match thtow an error
- Show a successful alert when user successfully signs up
